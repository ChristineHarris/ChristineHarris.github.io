### Regression

[Predicting “Floor” and “Ceiling” for NBA Draft Prospects]()

The draft is arguable the most critical off-season event in the NBA. For small-market teams, acquiring superstar talent through the draft is their only viable strategy to compete for a championship. For all teams, however, the draft represents a fantastic opportunity to add young talent to their roster with little associated financial risk. Due to the rise of analytics in the NBA over the last decade or so, teams now have access to large quantities of data they can use to evaluate prospects. Working with front offices can be tricky, however, because general managers and team presidents still value the importance of not-yet quantifiable factors such as susceptibility to injury, mental and emotional state, and basketball IQ. The main objective for this study, then, is to assess the ability of various Quantile Regression (QR) models – such as Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) and Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) – to predict a NBA prospect’s “floor” and “ceiling” potential. These models likely suffer from survivorship bias, however, as the training and test sets include only players who actually entered the league. To mitigate this issue, a separate model is built to identify which prospects can actually be considered NBA-caliber. These models, when used in conjunction with one another, can serve as a useful draft support tool that acknowledges the risks involved in predicting NBA performance and the tradeoff between drafting for reliability or potential.

### Deep Learning

[Using Neural Networks to Make NBA Game Outcome Predictions]()

In the following report, I attempt to predict the outcome of National Basketball Association (NBA) games with the use of neural networks. I collected the statistics for NBA games from the 2014-15 season to the 2017-18 season. I performed manual feature engineering on all match-related features to transform them into information that could have been known before each matchup. After performing feature selection and eliminating any highly-correlated features, I used the final dataset to train several different types of neural networks. These include feedforward neural networks (FNNs), radial basis function neural networks (RBFNs), and probabilistic neural networks (PNNs). The best network was only able to correctly predict the winning team 64.28% of the time. The results of this analysis go to show that predicting game outcomes over a number of seasons is a difficult task, as personnel changes each offseason can drastically alter a team's competitive value. As such, the incorporation of player-level (rather than team-level) data in future analyses may lead to significant improvements in model performance.

### Distributed Computing

[A Spatial Analysis of NCAA Shooting Behaviors]()

In this report, I show that the BigQuery Storage API and the Spark-BigQuery connector can be used to load and analyze the high volume of shooting data available for NCAA Men's Basketball. By running SQL queries on this dataset, I both quantify and visualize general shooting behaviors in the NCAA, as well as shooting trends that have developed over a five-season period. Additionally, I use non-negative matrix factorization to delve deeper into the underlying structure of NCAA player shooting distributions. By analyzing the resulting spatial basis functions, I can draw conclusions about different shot type preferences in the NCAA. By using non-negative matrix factorization as a clustering technique, I categorize players with similar shooting behaviors. Lastly, applying non-negative matrix factorization over several seasons separately, I visualize how shooting preferences have changed over time. The results of this analysis are useful in understanding how NCAA Men’s Basketball has developed over the past decade. These results could also help teams make optimal lineup selections, ensuring that every player is occupying the area on the court where they prefer to shoot.
